# Nyaa-Blacklist
Userscript to hide entries in Nyaa by keywords or categories.
It can also change entry colors by keyword.
Use it with Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey or whatever.

This will hide the desired entries. The hidden slots won't be replaced by other entries, but at least you won't see any 1080p Hi444p anymore.
