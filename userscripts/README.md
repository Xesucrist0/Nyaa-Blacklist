## filter_nyaa.js
Userscript to hide entries in Nyaa by keywords or categories.
It can also change entry colors by keyword.
Use it with Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey or whatever.

This will hide the desired entries. The hidden slots won't be replaced by other entries, but at least you won't see any 1080p Hi444p anymore.

## expand_anilist_trailers.js
Trailers' size in anilist is pretty small. I neither like fullscreening them nor opening a new tab. Those options are to many extra clicks and it is annoying. This script makes trailers watchable by expanding them a little.
