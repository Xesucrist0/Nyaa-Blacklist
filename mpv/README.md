# Scripts for MPV

## auto-delete.lua

It automatically deletes video files after shutting down MPV if filename contains "HorribleSubs" and playback exceeds 90% of total video duration.
Change values by yourself in the code, comment osd messages or whatever.

Slightly edited from [zenyd's script](https://github.com/zenyd/mpv-scripts)
