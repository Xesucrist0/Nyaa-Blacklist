## find_extensions.py
It counts how many files with an specific extension are on every folder of a directory tree given a list of extensions.
I use this (or little modifications) to find some archives or clean some stuff. Not really useful, but not useless either.

## music_encode.py
Script I use to encode an entire directory tree with qaac (you need it) and copy it to another folder, usually my phone.
